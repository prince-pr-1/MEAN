Here I will learn how can I create a web server for rest api
using http core node module. 

Note : This is an old method of creating a web server.

I learnt : 
    + How can I create a web server
    + How can I handle an http req
    + How can I send a response.

** After this I'll learn Expres.js library which will make 
all these tasks easier.
