1. To create a new node project, run npm init inside the project
directory.

2. npm init is used to create the package.json file

3. After/when creating the package.json file, be sure to add a
script which is used to run our project in easy way.

For instance, if we have to run our code from index.js, we might
use node index.js.

To make it more easier, we add a script in the package.json file.
ie, "start" : "node index.js".

Here, the start refers to the key word which we have to use
with npm to run the file. So it will be, npm start.

node index.js refers to the command we have to execute
when the "start" keyword is used.
